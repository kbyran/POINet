# POI
Person of Interest. A flexible computer vision library on human analysis, such as person re-identification, human attribute, pose estimation and dense pose estimation.

## Features
- **All in One.** Multiple tasks on human analysis are integrated into the one framework, relieving the trouble of maintaining several repositories.
- **Easy to Develop.** Simple baselines for each task are already implemented, and convenient for secondary development and research.
- **Fast to Deploy.** Support export deployment model on ONNX/TensorRT to make more devices compatible and particularly gain 50% speed-up on NVIDIA GPU.

## Preparation
- [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for installation.
- [DATASET.md](docs/DATASET.md) for dataset.
- [PRETRAINED.md](docs/PRETRAINED.md) for pretrained model.

## Getting Started
